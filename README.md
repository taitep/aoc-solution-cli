# aoc solution cli

tool for managing aoc solutions written in python.

## Commands
- `aocgen`: Generates a python file for provided day and year (command line options), containing a function for each puzzle part.
- `aocrun`: Runs a function in a file generated by `aocgen`, the function and file being determined by command line arguments `--day`, `--year` and `--part` (a or b). Requires you to be authenticated with [advent-of-code-data](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/). If flag `--submit` is provided, it will automatically submit the output to AoC.

When using both commands, day and year will be cached.
